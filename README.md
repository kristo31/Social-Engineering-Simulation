# Social-Engineering-Simulation


Social engineering is the tactic of manipulating, influencing, or deceiving a victim in order to gain control over a computer system, or to steal personal and financial information. It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.
Social engineering uses human weakness or psychology to gain access to the system, data, personal information, etc. It is the art of manipulating people. It doesn’t involve the use of technical hacking techniques. Attackers use new social engineering practices because it is usually easier to exploit the victim’s natural inclination to trust. For example, it is much easier to fool someone to give their password instead of hacking their password. Sharing too much information on social media can enable attackers to get a password or extracts a company’s confidential information using the posts by the employees. This confidential information helped attackers to get the password of victim accounts. 
The purpose of social engineering attacks is typically to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal information. Attackers can use this information for identity theft, financial fraud, or other malicious purposes. Another purpose of social engineering attacks is to gain unauthorized access to secure areas or systems. For example, an attacker might use tailgating to follow an authorized individual into a secure area or use pretexting to convince an individual to give them access to a restricted system.
